##Overview
OpenIMAJ is a set of open-source libraries and tools for multimedia content analysis and content generation that has been written for research projects at Southampton over many years. OpenIMAJ is very broad and contains everything from state-of-the-art computer vision and advanced data clustering, through to software that performs analysis on the content, layout and structure of webpages. You will need to use OpenIMAJ for all the COMP3204/6223 courseworks.

For this coursework, we want you to work through a portion of the [OpenIMAJ tutorial](http://www.openimaj.org/tutorial) in order to get a grasp of the underlying functionality and gain some experience in practical image processing and computer vision. Even though this is the first coursework to be set, the deadline is deliberately late in order to allow you to work through the tutorial in line with the underlying computer vision techniques as they are introduced in the lectures. 

You can consider this coursework to be like a set of labs in that the only requirement to get credit is that you provide us with evidence (i.e. code) that you have completed the relevant sections of the tutorial.

##Details
In order to complete the second coursework (which will be announced during Mark's lectures) you will need to have worked through [Chapter 1](http://www.openimaj.org/tutorial/getting-started-with-openimaj-using-maven.html) and [Chapter 2](http://www.openimaj.org/tutorial/processing-your-first-image.html). During Jon's part of the course the handout's accompanying the lectures will highlight the relevant chapter of the tutorial that demonstrates the topic of that lecture; these chapters of the tutorial are a prerequisite to successfully completing the third coursework.

###Summary of required tutorial chapters:

Before starting the second coursework (i.e. do it immediately!):

* [Chapter 1](http://www.openimaj.org/tutorial/getting-started-with-openimaj-using-maven.html)  
* [Chapter 2](http://www.openimaj.org/tutorial/processing-your-first-image.html)
* [Chapter 7]()

Before starting the third coursework:

* [Chapter 3]() 
* [Chapter 13]() 
* [Chapter 4]() 
* [Chapter 5]() 
* [Chapter 6]() 
* [Chapter 12]() 
* [Chapter 14]() 

###What to hand in
You need to submit to ECS Handin the following items enclosed in a zip file:

* The report (as a PDF document; max 2 A4 sides)
* Your code (including everything required to train and use your classifiers); in a sub-directory called "code" (note: please don't include the Maven 'target' directory or any of the images!)
* The run prediction files for your three runs (named "run1.txt", "run2.txt" and "run3.txt").

##Marking and feedback
Marks will be awarded for:
	
* Successful completion of the task.
* Good use of the OpenIMAJ library.
* Well structured and commented code.
* Good excellence of professionalism in implementation.
* Quality and contents of the report.
* The quality/soundness/complexity of approach used for run 3.


##Questions
If you have any problems/questions then [email](mailto:jsh2@ecs.soton.ac.uk) or speak to [Jon](http://ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jsh2), either in his office, or in one of the drop-in sessions in the UG-lab we'll run during the course.
