Welcome to the homepage for the ECS "Computer Vision" modules [COMP3204](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP3204) and [COMP6223](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP6223).

The challenge of computer vision is to develop a computer based system with the capabilities of the human eye-brain system. It is therefore primarily concerned with the problem of capturing and making sense of digital images. The field draws heavily on many subjects including digital image processing, artificial intelligence, computer graphics and psychology.

This course will explore some of the basic principles and techniques from these areas which are currently being used in real-world computer vision systems and the research and development of new systems.

The lectures for this course will be given by [Professor Mark Nixon](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/msn) ([email](mailto:msn@ecs.soton.ac.uk)) and <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jsh2">Dr Jonathon Hare</a> ([email](mailto:jsh2@ecs.soton.ac.uk)). Mark will give the lectures for the first part of the course, and Jon will finish with the second half.

Materials to accompany the lectures can be found here:

* [Part 1](part1.html) taught by Mark.
* [Part 2](part2.html) taught by Jon.
