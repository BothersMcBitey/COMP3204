Welcome to the homepage for the ECS "Computer Vision" modules [COMP3204](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP3204) and [COMP6223](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP6223).

The challenge of computer vision is to develop a computer based system with the capabilities of the human eye-brain system. It is therefore primarily concerned with the problem of capturing and making sense of digital images. The field draws heavily on many subjects including digital image processing, artificial intelligence, computer graphics and psychology.

This course will explore some of the basic principles and techniques from these areas which are currently being used in real-world computer vision systems and the research and development of new systems.

##Lectures
The lectures for this course will be given by [Professor Mark Nixon](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/msn) ([email](mailto:msn@ecs.soton.ac.uk)) and <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jsh2">Dr Jonathon Hare</a> ([email](mailto:jsh2@ecs.soton.ac.uk)). Mark will give the lectures for the first part of the course, and Jon will finish with the second half. 

There will be three lectures each week up to around the end of week 8; you'll then have about three week to work on your final coursework & Jon will make himself available in his office during the lecture slots for anyone looking for help or guidance. After the Christmas vacation we'll run a revision lecture and also give feedback on the group coursework. 

The lecture slots are as follows:

Day       | Time | Room   
----------|------|-----------------------
Tuesdays  | 3PM  | 5/2015 (Eustice LT/H)
Thursdays | 11AM | 2/1085 (Law LT/C)
Fridays   | 2PM  | 5/2017 (Eustice LT/J)
